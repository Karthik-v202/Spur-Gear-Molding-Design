# Spur Gear and Mold Design (Design for Manufacturing Project)

This repository contains the **3D model, assembly, and full manufacturing documentation** for a standard Spur Gear and the corresponding **two-part Cope and Drag mold** designed for casting or injection molding processes.  

This project was completed as part of an **Autodesk CAD course** and demonstrates **core competencies in mechanical design, DFM principles, and technical documentation**.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Skills Demonstrated  

- **Advanced CAD Modeling**: Creating complex geometries like involute gear teeth profiles in a 3D environment.  
- **Design for Manufacturing (DFM)**: Applying principles specific to mold design, including defining a precise parting line, incorporating draft angles, and calculating clearances for assembly alignment.  
- **2D Technical Documentation**: Generating professional, fully dimensioned engineering drawings (orthographic, sectional, and isometric views) that adhere to industry standards.  
- **Assembly and Kinematics**: Modeling multi-part systems (Gear + Mold Halves).  
- **Version Control**: Using Git/GitHub to manage and present design iterations and documentation.
